 * This is a non-blocking function to read the keypad.
 * If a key is pressed, it returns a unique code for the key. Otherwise,
 * a zero is returned.
 * The upper nibble of Port 4 is used as input and connected to the columns.
 * Pull-up resistors are enabled so when the keys are not pressed, these pins
 * are pulled high.
 * The lower nibble of Port 4 is used as output that drives the keypad rows.
 * First all rows are driven low and the input pins are read. If no key is pressed,
 * they will read as all one because of the pull up resistors. If they are not
 * all one, some key is pressed.
 * If some key is pressed, the program proceeds to drive one row low at a time and
 * leave the rest of the rows inactive (float) then read the input pins.
 * Knowing which row is active and which column is active, the program
 * can decide which key is pressed.
 *
 * Only one row is driven so that if multiple keys are pressed and row pins are shorted,
 * the microcontroller will not be damaged. When the row is being deactivated,
 * it is driven high first otherwise the stray capacitance may keep the inactive
 * row low for some time.)
